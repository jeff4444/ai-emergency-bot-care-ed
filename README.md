## Inspiration
Our inspiration for the project was the fact that about 70 percent of people feel very helpless during a medical emergency due to a lack of first aid knowledge and expertise


## What it does
CareEd allows people to get real time help and information to help them navigate helping another person through an emergency. 
They can have a voice chat with the AI trained on health data and then get step by step descriptions on what to do and get pictorial representations when need be. 
They can also get this data shared with health authorities so they can make more informed decisions when the arrive to the scene.


## How we built it
React; Flutter (for front-end) and python for the backend with Azure AI service for the LLM and Azure Blob storage for storing the training data.


## Challenges we ran into
Connecting the front-end to the back-end of the app


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building/training the LLM, thinking and coming up with an idea, learning about Azure and other programming languages


## What we learned
Azure and other programming languages


## What's next for CareEd
Investors, going worldwide, building the app till completion and enhancing user experience while learning and attending to emergencies.
